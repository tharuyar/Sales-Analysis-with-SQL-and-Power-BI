# Sales-Analysis-with-SQL-and-Power-BI

## Problem Statement

We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.
Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.
We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. 
The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.

I have collected the datasets from  the 'AdventureWorks database'

Flow of the project -
### Import Datasets in SQL

1.Importing files in SQL database
2.Based on the Bussiness requirement i have selected the required sets

### Data Cleansing and preprocessing
1.Analysing data inorder to consider required columns
2. Changing the column names in order to make  user friendly 
3.Used different - Join statements , Clauses , Distint functions to join related tables 

### Importing files to powerbi
After importing the files i have used Dax functions for caliculations

### Visualization
Used different vizualizations to create Dashboard for the analysis.
